# Proof-of-impact – A Blockchain-based Social Impact Credentialing System
Problem Statement:
Many individuals and organizations contribute to social and environmental causes, but there is no universally verifiable way to track and authenticate these contributions. Traditional certificates of participation or impact reports can be easily forged or manipulated.

Solution:
Proof of Impact (PoI) is a blockchain-based credentialing system that allows individuals and organizations to earn verified on-chain NFTs for their contributions to social causes. These NFTs serve as immutable proof of their efforts, making it easy for employers, grant agencies, and educational institutions to verify real-world impact.

Key Features:
Impact Tokenization – Contributions (e.g., volunteering hours, donations, climate action) are converted into soulbound NFTs (non-transferable).

Decentralized Verification – Smart contracts validate contributions using trusted oracles and partner organizations.

Reputation Score – Participants build a Web3 reputation score based on their impact history.

Cross-chain Compatibility – Supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana for cost-efficient transactions.

Interoperability with DAOs – NGOs and DAOs can issue credentials for contributors and access their impact profiles.

Gamification & Incentives – Users earn tokens or governance rights in social impact DAOs for sustained participation.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Blockchain: Solidity + Hardhat (Ethereum/Polygon)

Database: IPFS + Arweave (for storing impact proof)

Smart Contracts: OpenZeppelin libraries

Wallet Integration: MetaMask & WalletConnect

Oracle Services: Chainlink for verification

Real-World Impact:
Employers & Universities can verify volunteer work and social impact credentials.

Grant Agencies can fund projects based on on-chain reputation instead of manual reports.

Individuals can build a verifiable resume of social good, helping them stand out.
